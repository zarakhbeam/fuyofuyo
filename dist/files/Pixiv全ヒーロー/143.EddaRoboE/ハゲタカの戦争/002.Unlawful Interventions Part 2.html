<p>[chapter:Unlawful Interventions Part 2 ]</p>

<p>What a name. What a character! I was so giddy with anticipation! The we shared a few drinks among friends. The maids did their &quot;service&quot;, if you know what I mean! Hah!</p>

<p>Cohen guffaws. </p>

<p>Slept easy that night. First night in weeks I felt that good ya&#39; know? I even went to work the next day. I was still sidelined in my hoverchair, like some gimp, but I was at work. Doing my thing, planning the newest season of my reality show, meeting with lawmakers and my fellow special interest representatives. Good times were back. A few days later while I was in the middle of a meeting when my secretary told me I had a call on the &quot;personal business&quot; line. It was our guy...! &quot;Took care of that muthafuckah&#39; for you.&quot; If I could, I&#39;d have jumped like a giddy boy on Christmas morning! I mouthed to the rest of the guys that our problem was solved. Such a relief. You could see it on their faces. Mine too. &quot;We&#39;re gonna need one hell of a can opener! &quot; Senator Turtlert always with the one liners. &quot;I&#39;ll show you the proof tonight. Your place. At 8. Though, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to tell what it is I got with me.&quot; Oh man, so brutal! So cold...</p>

<p>-Well  it was Maim, the Infamous underworld assassin. He&#39;d been quite a character to be reckoned with in his day.-</p>

<p>We had Southern fried chicken for dinner that night. The maids made it especially for us. They were with us too. We were all havin&#39; a great time.  Some of us more than others. That Dutch..</p>

<p>A small smile escapes the corner of his mouth</p>

<p>Dutch really was a glutton. He&#39;s the only guy I know who had fried chicken-- no, just eat period, while getting a blowjob. Turtlert still cursed Maim, &quot;Boyah still wrecked my truck.&quot; taking a big bite out of that corn on the cob. The buzzer rang while I was sipping my iced tea. It was my security chief, telling me that our boy was home. I had given the guards the night off earlier. They were probably in the pool house playing cards or fucking the maids. After giving him the OK I went back to my food. Madeline our head maid, classy gal, was visibly upset at Dutch asking for some favors. Dutch had no self control. When he wasn&#39;t on the satellite channels running his mouth and annoying and offending wussies everywhere, he was stuffing his face with anything, popping pills and jamming hyposprays, and trying to fuck everything with legs. An offensive kinda guy, but pretty cool to get along with when you got to know him. But man, he really needed self control. Madeline, the classy broad she politely asked him to finish his serving first.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-That seems kind of uncharacteristic, for a person who... Who is..-</p>

<p>Greedy? Look, I had a lot. A Lot, ok? And yeah, I was greedy. I wanted more, and anyone who told me no, pissed me off and only emboldened me to remove them.  But damn, if you stuff your face with food like that, you&#39;re not even going to enjoy its taste. Much less, enjoy getting blown by a girl while you&#39;re busy gulping entire drumsticks of fried chicken. Everything just felt so great that night. Knock on the door. &quot;Mr. Maim, here for you.&quot; It was Nancy, my mousy four eyed maid. &quot;Lettem in!&quot; Poom! The doors flew off their hinges and into the glass windows on the other side of our dining room. We were startled for a second. &quot;Cohen son, you better charge that oversized nigger for these damages!&quot; barked Turtlert. A loud sudden wet thud came at my feet. The blood splattered all over me and some of my guests, and the floor. &quot;You fucked him up really good big man!&quot; squealed one of the maids.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I looked down at the floor for a sec.  Lots of blood covered the body. &quot;Oh fuuuuuuck!&quot; screamed Turtlert. I looked over to him just as fast. Doon doon doon doon doon doon doon! The Kentucky senator&#39;s torso was blasted full of holes. He staggered to the floor hearing him take his final dump. The maids were running and screaming, half naked, half clothed and all slimy. Dutch still held onto his girl, even as she was pissing herself scared! What the fuck was going on? When the maids had cleared the room, I almost cried. </p>

<p>His eyes are now redder in color. Mr. Cohen covers both his eyes with his thumb and index finger.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>Eddarion was standing there, just a bit past the blown open doors. That suit of his was cracked a good bit by the chest and shoulders and in one leg. Burn marks across the damaged places. The visor on his helmet was cracked, but it wasn&#39;t shattered. He had my maid Nancy restrained from behind in an arm lock. She was crying and struggling begging to be let go. The asshole twisted her arm slightly, and shoved her away with his boot. &quot;Find a new line of work young lady.&quot; he said in a subdued growled.  Nancy stumbled onto her face and just as quickly, ran off.  </p>

<p>-How did he---- -</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I wanted to know. How the fuck did this happen? How did he get past my chief? What the fuck happened?  And then there was that constant persistent scream. It was the maid that Dutch was busy fucking! He was still holding onto her, probably having no idea what was going on. My panic took a backseat, when I felt a reassuring hand place itself on my shoulder. It was my senior maid, Madeline. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Master Cohen, it&#39;ll be alright.&quot; She walked past me, and over to this blood thirsty psycho pausing half way. &quot;Mr. Grimbagh, would you please release my maid for the time being? If you do, I will give you a nice reward afterward.&quot; That quickly got his attention. Dutch had been wanting to screw Madeline for years! &quot;Huh, what?&quot; He let her go, and she took off like a jackrabbit. A Naked screaming  jack rabbit. &quot;Holy crap what in the world is going on here?!&quot;</p>

<p>-You mean, Mr. Grimbagh didn&#39;t know what was going on around him?-</p>

<p>You mean you couldn&#39;t figure that out? You&#39;re a dope. &quot;Mr. Eddarion, please leave now. It is very rude of you to come here at night in this manner.&quot; She just smiled at him, her eyes closed. &quot;Sorry lady, I kind of was the most important guest here tonight.&quot; She opened her eyes, and dropped the smile. &quot;Then you are uninvited now.&quot; Psycho Cop aimed that blaster at Madeline, cartwheeling into him and kicking it out of his hand, then sweep kicked him onto the floor. Maddy thrust her heel at his head, but the bastard squirmed out of the way, rolling back onto his feet. </p>

<p>-Madeline did that?-</p>

<p>Why do you think I made her head maid? The gravity of the situation finally sunk in on Dutch. &quot;Holy crap, he&#39;s alive Benson!&quot; I threw a leftover biscuit at his fat ass. He got his shit together and bolted for the door, his pants and underwear at his ankles. Eddarion just dropped kicked him*, Dutch flung into the corner onto his ass. Madeline grabbed his [Eddarion] leg and like, twisted her body quickly, spinning him like a corkscrew.</p>

<p>He does the motion of a Dragon Screw leg throw.</p>

<p>Then like, these blades came from under her wrists and she just zipped at him like a lightning bolt. The sound of metal clanging sharply were followed by sparks and a grunt of pain as my Maddy just slashed this loose cannon with a badge across his back and his chest. He staggered back and did this weirdo motion, and this glowing blade popped out of thin air and into his hand. My Maddy went in for another pass, this time however he matched each of her swipes and slashes with that glowstick of a sword. Now was the time to get out, hovering away from this clusterfuck. I was constantly pressing the panic button on my watch. Where the hell were my security guards? That thought quickly was replaced by how my hoverchair was now a burning pile of debris. I looked behind me after getting my face out of the floor. It was Eddarion&#39;s energy blade sticking out the side of my poor hover chair. Maddy raced to me, but she was cut off as he [Eddarion] made a big freakish long jump all the way over to me, yanking his sword and put it at my throat. &quot;You move and the scumbag dies!&quot; he warned my maid. All she could do was curse him.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-A prisoner...-</p>

<p>&quot;How in the world did you fucking do all this?&quot; He barked at me to shut up. &quot;It amazing how you can persuade people to say things when you got their balls to the fire.&quot; Oh what a smug asshole he was. &quot;Never mind your security chief. He values his life more than he does your own.&quot;  He directed Madeline to go over to the bloody body and turn it over. It was Maim! He was missing his legs, and his huge massive killer arms were shredded and mangled. He was barely alive. How in the world could he be barely alive after what this monster must have put him through?! &quot;Hey Maddy, I want you to slit his throat.&quot; Madeline&#39;s eyes widened, looking back to him. I kept pressing my watch until security arrived. &quot;Do it now or he&#39;s dead!&quot; Shouting. &quot;Wait..  What about my money?&quot; It was Maim! He was still in there somehow. &quot;You won&#39;t need it where you&#39;re going.&quot; He shot back. &quot; Maddy, slit his throat now!&quot; Eddarion pressed the energy sword to my neck, blood trickling lightly as it burned my skin.  She looked hesitant. What the hell, she was my bodyguard. Why was she hesitating? </p>

<p>-Could it be she did not like hurting someone unarmed?-</p>

<p>I dunno, maybe. &quot;Maddy just kill the motherfucker!&quot; I screamed, my voice breaking. &quot;C&#39;mon man! I ain&#39;t done nothin&#39; to you ye----&quot; and that was that. She slit his throat, one of the greatest hitmen of all time gagging on his own blood.  Eddarion just looked on as Maddy coldly got up from the floor, putting herself in a attack stance. Nasty blood staining her wrist blade. &quot;You didn&#39;t think I wouldn&#39;t notice you calling for your guards did I? You just made a big mistake!&quot; yanking my security watch from my wrist smashing it on the floor. &quot;Madeline, think fast!&quot; He tossed me at her, catching me. What a strong woman. It was all a distraction to allow Eddarion to get his blaster. He rolled on the floor to pick it up. He was behind Maddy while she held me. &quot;Alright, Madeline now drop him. Slowly.&quot; Drop me? ! What? She dropped me like a bag of cement, turned around and swiped the gun from his hands, pointed it at his face and BOOM! Nothing... The gun didn&#39;t fire. &quot;Galactic Federation Standard Issue Energy Blaster-Sword. Only recognizes the biosignature of its user.&quot; What a smug asshole. Madeline got punched in the gut, though she easily took it better than me. I could hear my men from around the corridor. He could too... Dragging her off from the floor he proceeded to tear off her uniform, and her wrist blades, putting his gun behind her back until she was only in her stockings and her shoes. When my security arrived, he shoved her into their way, distracted at the hot bod&#39; the chief maid had. To some it was the last thing they ever saw, cuz he blasted  several of my men into Swiss cheese. One of them swung a heat cleaver at him, but like the freak he was, easily sidestepped it grabbing his wrist and twisting it, before punching him so hard he flew out the window. My last three men... One of them got kicked in the face, the other shot in the stomach, and the last one thrown onto our dinner table buried  in mashed potatoes, corn and chicken.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-And what happened with Madeline?-</p>

<p>She just stood there in place like a deer in the headlights. He [Eddarion] pointed his blaster at her back, grabbing her by her upper arm. &quot;Hands in the air now!&quot; What the hell was she doing?! Why is she just going along with him? He cuffed her and put the gun to the back of her head. &quot;Leave, Now!&quot; I was beggin&#39; her to come back. She stopped and turned to me &quot;I&#39;m sorry Master, but I don&#39;t want to die just yet. I&#39;m grateful for the service you let me  provided  this decade. It&#39;s all about survival and staying on top. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll understand.&quot;  She walked off, took the leopard skinned robe from my coat rack, Eddarion helped her put it on and was on her way. He [Eddarion] never dropped focus on her. His gun trained on her the entire time until she was out of his view. Then, his focus was on me. I was done for. I desperately crawled away, his hand grabbing my leg and dragging me back to him. &quot;What the fuck do you want from me!?&quot; I cursed.  He pistol whipped me in return. My mouth full of loose teeth. &quot;Benny, Benny, Benny... Tell me, why do you think I&#39;m angry?&quot; I told him to fuck off, while I scuttled back on my ass. He flicked my nose. &quot;You tried to kill me, Benny. You know that anger you&#39;re feeling right now? Well, I&#39;m feeling that too!&quot; He put his arm around my shoulder. &quot;Except the difference here is that I have every fucking reason to be angry at you, and you don&#39;t!&quot; Roaring like a crazy beast straight into my ear. He told me, that it must be the very first time anyone ever opposed me.</p>

<p>-Is it true?-</p>

<p>No. Plenty of people have told me no. And all of those dopes are gone! But this was the first time anyone ever told me &quot;No&quot;  and had the strength to tell me to fuck off. I really hated that. &quot;Isn&#39;t this how you like it? The big fish eats the little fish? Well that makes me a fucking Great White now doesn&#39;t it?!&quot;  He slapped me now. An open handed slap! &quot;Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeee!!!!&quot; It was Dutch! He came around and was right on top of him! When he turned his head BOOM. Headshot. Dutch managed to grab the scattergun from under the dinner table. &quot;Very nice.&quot; Top of the line M113 Shotgun only pecked this freak&#39;s helmet. </p>

<p>-It&#39;s a very durable alloy but flexible alloy.-</p>

<p>The lights on his suit went off like a Christmas tree, and the glow on his visor highlighted two glowing yellow eyes. The cruelty in those eyes. Disturbed individual, this so-called hero was. Dutch was smacked across the face with his own gun! And he still had his pants and underwear at his ankles! And that extra strength Viagra he took was still in effect! His pecker was as stiff as it was when he was fucking that maid from earlier. &quot;You know I actually think you&#39;re funny once in a while Dutch. But you&#39;re such an asshole creep.&quot; He stood over him. Dutch&#39;s eyes widened. That look he had on his face. I&#39;d seen it plenty of times before, on stupid reporters or nobodies who didn&#39;t know when to keep their big nose where it don&#39;t belong. &quot;That maid you wanted to fuck.. Madeline? She was really hot! Is that why you&#39;re still excited Dutch-boy?&quot; Dutch was pleading with him to stop. &quot;Self Control!&quot; Eddarion raised his foot over Dutch&#39;s crotch. Dutch was screaming off the top of his head, begging &quot;No No No&quot; even a big &quot;Nooooooooo!&quot; I closed my eyes and looked away. Squish. His begging turned to crying and screaming. &quot;Learn it!&quot; Dutch was rolling on the floor crying. Guys like this... Who abuse their power like that? They make me sick! Laws were created to protect us from them, and here he is just pissing all over it. Doing whatever he wanted.</p>

<p>-Didn&#39;t you find any of this awkward? Or Ironic?-</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>-Never mind.-</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>Anyway, so Dutch was cradling himself and crying. &quot;I bet that hurts. But wait, you carry lots of pills on you right? Always popping them and stuff. Hold on.&quot; He reached into Dutch&#39;s jacket, and you bet, found a decent sized jar of pills. &quot;I really do not like inflicting harm. Don&#39;t get me wrong. There&#39;s the most beautiful little blond French boy, with the kindest mom and dad who are my  biggest fans. I signed some college kid&#39;s trading card collection. I even helped an old lady cross the street! How often does that happen? I really don&#39;t like hurting good honest people like that.&quot; Dutch was still bawlin&#39;. &quot;But I make special exceptions for guys like you who think they&#39;re good and really honest and really special!&quot; Dutch. Still bawlin&#39;. I doubt he heard that shit he was spewing. &quot;Stop crying! &quot; The lid of the jar was unscrewed and stuffed the pills straight into his pus. &quot;Benny, going around and picking on people smaller and weaker than you is really, really, really, wrong.&quot; What a fucking hypocrite. &quot;You run some pencil necked wimp in front of the whole world to see, and some guy comes in and puts you in your place, And you get mad at me?&quot; He slapped me across the face again. &quot;You talk about bigger fish eating the little fish, fight to survive, only the strong survive, the rich and strong deserve to rule the poor and weak. Yadda yadda, and whatever other stupid shit that ugly Russian bitch said hundreds of years ago.&quot; I told him to fuck off again. &quot;You sure can&#39;t take it can you?&quot;  He stood over me. &quot;You know, as a kid I actually thought you were kind of a cool guy. Guess people grow up.&quot; I could only curse at him. &quot;You&#39;re fucking dead! You&#39;re ruined! I&#39;ll sue!&quot; Again, he slapped me across the head with his pistol. &quot;Benny, if I ever have to come after you again I will kill you.&quot; I told him to fucking kill me already. &quot;I&#39;m a man of mercy. I&#39;ve got no good reason to kill you now.&quot; I goaded him on, warning him that I&#39;ll send someone else after him. &quot;If you do, I hope it&#39;s that hot Korean girl! Uh... Sara? Sarai?&quot; What was wrong with this guy? God damn it, why was he not afraid of me? </p>

<p>-Could it be that your entire frustration over this was because he simply defied you?-</p>

<p>YES! </p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re so stupid. When of these days when you are least looking---&quot; and he just cut me off. &quot;Benny, I beat your roided up genetic freak, and humiliated megamaid. How much more until you learn---&quot; he raised his voice like a fucking lion &quot;that you do not fuck with me without a fight!&quot; I cursed at him, that I&#39;ll send more. He crouched beside me, grabbed some tube from that notch on the side of his suit. &quot;You look like you&#39;re in pain. Let me help.&quot; The fucker jammed an entire tube of extra strength morphine into my arm! Not just any, but that weird strong shit from the Galactic Federation! For all the pain it took away, I was still kind of pissed off. &quot;Well then, I  guess I&#39;ll see you in the soup kitchen one of these days.&quot; He called the paramedics, and just walked off. God damn it, the nerve of that asshole! I was left with this mess! The room stank of blood and shit. And of course there was the broken glass and wood splinters everywhere. He fucking ruined my dining room! Mitch was dead, The Hitman was dead, Dutch was shitting and crying himself silly. All my maids had left, my security detail was dead. And to top it all off, Madeline was gone!</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-And your security chief?-</p>

<p>I fucking fired his ass the next day!</p>

<p>-Did you ever send any more assassins after him?-</p>

<p>No, but I sure as hell did try. Sarai Seiryu declined, citing conflict of interest. And oddly enough the Black Lizard from Italy said the same thing too. And as for me? Well I was in the hospital again for over two weeks again. The government was also breathing down my neck, showing some spine for a change demanding to know why a US Senator was killed in my home!</p>

<p>-Did you tell them that Eddarion had killed him and your hitmen?-</p>

<p>Of course! But they weren&#39;t even going to bother messing with that can of worms. </p>

<p>Mr. Cohen catches his breath. The security guard motions to me that our time is up.</p>

<p>-Will you tell me about the US Coup the next time?-</p>

<p>Buddy, there ain&#39;t gonna to be a next time. I hated every moment of this  interview... </p>

<p>And with that, Mr. Cohen is escorted out of the visitor area. Without Mr. Cohen, I am left with the task of finding the next person involved with the US Coup Attempt, Roger Allens former head of Action McNews.</p>

<p>*-According to Eddarion, he did not in fact, use a drop kick, but a wheel kick. </p>
