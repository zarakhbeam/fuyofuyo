<p>Unlawful Interventions</p>

<p>Attica Supermax Penitentiary, Attica New York.  </p>

<p>It is another cold New York state winter. The snow from this week&#39;s cold front is slowly sprinkling the massive lawns of this supermax sized prison. With a history of being the final resting place of the country&#39;s most dangerous and prolific criminals, today&#39;s interview was considered one of the most slippery criminals in recent US history. Today I am with former political lobbyist and vice president of the Cynetron Corporation, Benson Cohen.  It is with complete irony and perhaps a twisted moment of fate, that only 10 years ago what sent this man to prison, was considered legal for several decades. Glancing to the publicity photo of a somewhat handsome man, carefully interwoven combed black hair with grey on the sides, sporting a confident smile and a $100 bill in between his thumb and index finger. The upper left corner of the bill is caught by an ember. The man sitting across me behind security glass is now thoroughly grayed, with much of his hair receded. The image of confidence projected from this man is now just indifference. Most interesting of all, are the morphine patches decked out all across his arms. </p>

<p>-Correctional facilities keep dangerous people away from society as a punishment. Do you think you were properly punished? Has your time here given you anything to think about, or learn?-</p>

<p>He sighs a bit, but answers my question.</p>

<p>Dangerous? </p>

<p>Snorts a little laughter.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder who the dangerous ones really are.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-As in...?-</p>

<p>As in the costumed freaks, and brains who go around doing stuff where they aren&#39;t wanted or needed.&quot;</p>

<p>-Freaks? Why that term?-</p>

<p>Freaks. As in against the natural order. Tell me, is nature ever wrong? When nature does their natural selection, the whole &quot;dinosaurs were too big and fat and dumb, so rats survived&quot;, &quot;dodo birds had no sense of fear and couldn&#39;t fly and get eaten alive by dogs&quot;, does nature always prove itself right? The ones who survive are the ones who proved themselves. They never got any help from anyone. It&#39;s like the NBA; The Best Team Always Wins. That&#39;s about as true and pure as you get in real life.&quot;</p>

<p>-Speaking about that, the limousine incident..-</p>

<p>Which one guy?</p>

<p>-The one in Washington DC.-</p>

<p>Yeah, again, which one guy?</p>

<p>-The one where your limo struck a pedestrian-</p>

<p>You&#39;re not making this any easier for me!</p>

<p>Raising his voice and sitting up, slightly annoyed.</p>

<p>-The one that would lead to events getting you put in jail.-</p>

<p>Cohen&#39;s eyes flare for a second before sitting down.</p>

<p>Yeah. Alright, you wanna know? Fine. I was working at Liberty For America as a consultant around that time. It was breakfast time, watching Action McNews In The AM. I was supposed to have a meeting with Senator Turtlert and some of the other guys later that day. Normal day, right? In the middle of my coffee I hear my name on TV; some scrawny squeaky voiced blonde geek in glasses is there blabbering his trap calling me an &quot;entitled douche&quot;.  Uh, Delvin Danilo was this guy&#39;s name. It was a clip from one of Prison TV&#39;s political shows from last night.</p>

<p>He glances at his old publicity photo I have on me.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>That&#39;s the photo he was whining about when he called me out on TV! Whatever, punk calls me a douche, whatever. But then he just has to open his big rude, disrespectful mouth again. They play a clip where he calls me a &quot;creepy bald pervert&quot;, while the clip shows me staring at some reporter broad&#39;s chest at a Hollywood event. You got no idea how mad that got me.</p>

<p>-You made a phone call to Action In The AM that morning didn&#39;t you?-</p>

<p>Yeah.  I&#39;m friends with the hosts on Action In The AM,  and I call em&#39; on the phone live, and they have me on the air &quot;Delvin you little piece of garbage, if I see you on the street you are nothing!&quot; Hilda let out a big &quot;woo&quot;! Doocie and Kilmie just applauded like a pair of dopes. I name dropped and then left. So anyway, I was in my limo on the way to the office, going nowhere at all, stuck in traffic. Pretty boring stuff huh? Dozed off for what was probably 5 or 10 minutes, when the traffic let up and started moving again. I was wide awake when my face got mushed into the window of my ride when my driver hit the gas. Easily the nicest rude awakening ever.</p>

<p>-What do you mean by &quot;the nicest&quot;?-</p>

<p>The geek! He was right across the street from where I was! Having a coffee and walking his way back to the studio probably. I told the driver to follow him, and we did into the studio&#39;s parking lot. That&#39;s when I told him to floor it, and he was street pizza.</p>

<p>-You ran him over, as the incident report and cameras pointed out.-</p>

<p>Cameras? Who&#39;s going to care. Are you forgetting this was DC? We practically--- No we did own the town! Who would stop me?</p>

<p>The fire in his eyes revived on the memory, leaning back in his chair. Confidence fills the puffy wrinkled face of this man into a slight smile. To call it a smug expression would not be an exaggeration or a lie. </p>

<p>I stepped out of the car and found poor Danilo on the ground, crawling away from my limo. I couldn&#39;t help but let out a little chuckle. &quot;Hey son, sorry about that!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Cohen&#39;s smiles on the memory</p>

<p>I crouched down to the punk, patting him on his head. &quot;You look like shit, son!&quot; Again, he tried crawling away. His legs were mangled, and there was a lot of the red stuff all over his suit. People started gathering around the scene. &quot;Hey, this is none of your business! Butt out!&quot; My driver stood beside me cracking his knuckles. I loved the big guy! The little ladies and old fat asses scattered before I even finished. I heard something faint. It was Danilo gasping for something. I motioned to my driver for some water. &quot;Why?&quot; he whined. &quot;Why? Because you&#39;re a rude disrespectful little kid, in a grownups world&quot;. The stink from his suit and the hot weather was really unpleasant.  It was the middle of August, so no surprise. &quot;You hurt my feelings Danny boy! Never ever mock someone&#39;s hair. It&#39;s just not right.&quot;  My driver emptied the bottle over his head. &quot;Liking your drink? It&#39;s really hot out here! Must be at least 90 degrees. &quot; Again, he cried &quot;why&quot;. &quot;Whyyy whyyy whyyy?&quot; </p>

<p>Mr. Cohen emphasizes in a mocking voice. </p>

<p>Can you believe that? He was even saying it like that! &quot;Whyy whyy whyy!&quot; I looked over to my driver. &quot;What are you stupid or something? The boss just told you why!&quot; &quot;Yeah, seriously guy. My limo driver ain&#39;t that smart.&quot; I winked at my driver. &quot;Yeah, and if I call you stupid, you must be pretty dim.&quot; Danillo boy just crawled off &quot;Help me! Help!&quot; you could barely hear him. Very weak. &quot;You can&#39;t even call for help? With that squeaky voice of yours?&quot; I pat him on the shoulder. I felt like giving him a hand. &quot;Help! Help! Heeeeelp! Help me!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Cohen again emphasizes his mocking voice, barely containing his laughter.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>&quot;Help me!&quot; I was joined by my driver. &quot;Someone help! Help! Heeelp! Anybody?&quot; Well obviously, nobody wanted to help him. What a world huh? Welp, that&#39;s that.</p>

<p>-Except...-</p>

<p>Except what?</p>

<p>&quot;Except somebody did---&quot;</p>

<p>Alright alright, I&#39;ll get to that! So, I was there just making this little guy&#39;s day miserable. I can&#39;t say he didn&#39;t have it coming after all, that&#39;s how it is in nature. The big fish eats the little fish. You mess with someone, someone messes with them back!</p>

<p>He regains his breath and composure. The renewed life in his face is now only a scowl. </p>

<p>&quot;Anybody call for help?&quot; It was a metallic soft spoken but firm voice. Right behind me. I saw my driver reach for the pistol in his right underarm sling. Doon doon doon doon doon doon!</p>

<p>He inhales a small breath before releasing.</p>

<p>My driver slumped over onto his knees,  one and a half inch holes, still smoking blown straight through him. I could see some of the TV studio from him with all the holes he just got blasted with. He wobbled to the front a bit like some guy sleep walking. Again, doon doon doon doon doon doon doon then Thud. Heard the  splatter when he hit the asphalt. </p>

<p>Cohen sips a paper cup of water, his brow reflecting the memory. I felt the still warm weapon pressed against my neck, coming up from an angle. &quot;Turn around, slowly with your hands in the air.&quot; At that moment, I knew this joker had no idea what he got himself into. Just some stupid cop, who clearly did not know how the rules were played in this town. I smiled, and turned around. It was not exactly what I had expected.</p>

<p>-And this was?-</p>

<p>It was a cop alright, but not the normal kind. It was that stupid loose cannon space cop, who had a kids&#39; TV show from a year or so before. Isn&#39;t that sick? They make the exploits of a psycho like this guy a kids&#39; show!  There he was decked out in that white and blue tech armor suit. Funny, he&#39;s a lot shorter in person. &quot;You&#39;re going to jail. I saw everything on television Genius. Or did you forget that you&#39;re right outside a TV station?&quot; </p>

<p>There was that mocking voice again.</p>

<p>I bet he must have thought he was real smart saying that. &quot;Jail? You&#39;re wasting your time. Or did you forget where you&#39;re at &#39;Genius&#39;?&quot; He didn&#39;t care. The law meant nothing to a guy like this. The asshole just pistol whipped me and shoved me onto the hood of my limo. I think he called the paramedics or something, I couldn&#39;t remember because that fucker smacked his gun onto my face a few seconds earlier. Do you have any idea of how illegal the things he was doing to me were?</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-Well, it didn&#39;t seem to bother him too much.-</p>

<p>Of course not. His type, and especially this mook were known for not just breaking the rules, but blowing them up in your face! While he was helping poor Danny boy, I reached into my sleeve for my Mini-Popper. What an idiot this guy was, not even patting me down for a weapon.</p>

<p>-You were pulling a concealed weapon on an officer of the law?-</p>

<p>Uh, duh? Self defense laws? In DC? C&#39;mon now... These laws were made so Americans could defend themselves and not get prosecuted for basically saving their own skin. These laws were made to protect Americans from abusive police officials, so they wouldn&#39;t be prosecuted. Meh. Not that it mattered. I emptied my entire cartridge at the freak.</p>

<p>-And what happened?-</p>

<p>He cracks his knuckles, and lets out another short breath.</p>

<p>He caught five of the bullets with his  left hand, slapped away 2 with his pistol, and let the last one hit him as it ricocheted of that stupid suit of his, and into my leg. God damn it ,that hurt.! I didn&#39;t even get a full chance to feel it. Before I knew it, there was a sharp crushing pain in my right hand. The pig was crushing my hand while my finger was still on the trigger. The mangled and dangled purple that was now my right hand happened so quick, I didn&#39;t even get a chance to register what was going on. What happened next, was easily the worst of that morning. I felt all the air escape me. I was now on my knees gasping for air, holding my stomach. He muttered something about &quot;Making this too enjoyable&quot; or some sick crap like that. </p>

<p>-You should consider yourself lucky. Space Special Investigators can hit a lot harder than that if they desired.-</p>

<p>At that point, I was already wishing I were dead. And to top off everything this asshole just did to me, he grabbed my collar and smashed me head first into all the limo&#39;s glass windows. This asshole had to pay. When I came to, I found myself feeling really light, and floaty. Nice even. I was inside a police station cuffed at my wrists. I was still baffled as to how I was able to feel this way after being put through that meat grinder of a sicko. While I leaned back on the police station&#39;s bench I had just noticed an extra large syringe of morphine jammed into my elbow artery. I saw him at the front desk with DC police. What the hell is a space cop doing with DC pigs anyway? I could barely make out what was said, but all I got was a really loud &quot;God Damn It.&quot; The DC cops didn&#39;t looked too pleased either with what they told him. Which must mean good for me right? Space Cop threw his arms up in frustration and walked off. He stopped by me &quot;You&#39;re so fucking lucky this country has stupid laws.&quot; Hah! He even gave me a good headbutt, which I didn&#39;t feel thanks to the morphine he must have given me. </p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-Could you explain to readers, why you did not go to jail? Was it because he abused his role as a space police officer?-</p>

<p>Abuse? Yeah right! Everything he did was perfectly legal! Do you have any idea how wrong it is to have someone that powerful with that much immunity to the law? You can just go wherever you want, do whatever you like, and answer to no one. That is just wrong.</p>

<p>-Maybe?-</p>

<p>Either way, I was exercising my right to Self Defense. Specifically The DC Self Defense Act, made to protect lawmakers and special interests representatives who defend themselves when attacked.</p>

<p>-But...-</p>

<p>A law like that was specially tailored for Washington DC. See, what&#39;s good in one place is not necessarily good for the rest of the country you know? </p>

<p>-What happened then?-</p>

<p>I was let go without any charges of course.  I couldn&#39;t call anyone because my phone got busted, and I couldn&#39;t go anywhere either. My limo driver was Swiss cheese-- can you imagine that? He just killed him in cold blood! I&#39;ll never understand that. Just so wrong, everything.</p>

<p>-What do you mean by &quot;everything&quot;?-</p>

<p>Everything about that wannabe hero. Their kind. Especially his. They think they can go in and enforce their thinking of the law, or worse, just ignore it and they have the means to get away with it. It goes against the natural order. There&#39;s winners and there&#39;s losers in nature, and then some asshole shows up and throws a wrench and pisses all over what nature did the last million years! </p>

<p>He sighs.</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>Anyway, I had a really bad day. Spent a few hours in the emergency room and took a cab home. It didn&#39;t help one bit, when the morphine&#39;s effect stopped later that afternoon. Right in the middle of dinner, it all rushed back. The maids who were feeding me freaked out when I suddenly screamed in pain. One of the dumb broads dropped my soup onto my lap! I don&#39;t want to go into anymore details, buy I&#39;ll just say I spent about a week and a half in the hospital doped up on morphine, itching to get back at that pig.</p>

<p>-Court records say you did not return to work until the end of the month though. Would you care to elaborate what happened?-</p>

<p>Heh. Oh, I was still working. Just outside of the office. People came to me, instead of the typical boardroom meetings. Boardroom meetings with nothing on, but a hospital gown and instant lunch and dinner tubes piling up in the trash bin beside me.</p>

<p>-What did these boardroom meetings cover?-</p>

<p>You know, the typical senate and congressional budgets, social programs, and economic reforms. Things, you know?</p>

<p>-And...?-</p>

<p>Assassination and Coup D&#39; Ta plans... You know, sabotage the President&#39;s government left and right. Conjure up some astroturfed political movement to weaken his hold on power. Even plan a coup or hit, if it didn&#39;t work. Things were that bad for the country. Really, really, bad.  Oh yeah, and I personally asked the guys if we could hire the best and strongest hitman out there to kill---</p>

<p>[newpage]</p>

<p>-The President of the United States?-</p>

<p>Nah. That&#39;s what the coup was for. If the coup would succeed, it would mean we wouldn&#39;t be fingered. If it didn&#39;t, we&#39;d be long gone by then. S.M.E.A.R., Lunar Colonies, any of the Space Colonies, we would be long gone before it would happen. Plotting to assassinate the President rather than just have a coup was less safe. Who I really wanted rubbed out was the bastard who put me in the humiliating situation where I was sipping my meals out of a straw for 2 weeks! I even needed a cybernetic replacement hand! Getting rid of him would be sending a message to anybody who even thought about messing with us, rubbing out a potential constant threat, and I&#39;d be gettin&#39; my revenge.  </p>

<p>-Did you have some kind of planning in case the Union of Superheroes would get involved?-</p>

<p>See, we normally don&#39;t think about dealing with costumed  weirdos. Ever since they signed to the Non-Interference Pact, you know just fighting other Costumed Freaks who &quot;wanna rule the world&quot; and junk and not messing with political affairs, we never really put too much thought into how to deal with them. They just accepted it as the law and obeyed it to the letter. Things like this asshole pig, and that Violent Dope were an oddity. Oh and that cowboy in Northern Mexico, too.  There were a couple more of them to be sure, but those are the only ones who ever screwed with us or our friends. Anyway... one of our contacts in the S.M.E.A.R. pointed us in the direction of the best in the business. And all it would cost us was $500,000,000!</p>

<p>-That is a staggering amount.-</p>

<p>Really? That&#39;s kind of nothing really. Anyway, I distinctly remember the day we met our guy. To be frank, I wasn&#39;t impressed at all. He looked like nothing! Here was this scrawny lanky black man in a suit. Probably 5&#39;10 at most. He wasn&#39;t unhandsome, but he really did not seem like a killer. So there he was, showing off his demonstration to us. I was still in my wheelchair, maids still feeding me my soup. I wonder how they&#39;d react if they ever found out I was just faking just so I could be fed this way? So the yard stick paced himself back a good 20 feet from where we were. Senator Mitchell Turtlert and Dutch were invited to see, and they too weren&#39;t impressed. Mitch put in a  great  one liner &quot;Someone didn&#39;t have their fried chicken growing up!&quot;.  That drew a laugh from the guys. God, I loved Mitch! So we all got really quiet. Our skinny friend here took in a big deep breath, and just squatted! He looked like he was taking the biggest dump ever! All that grunting and growling, I was sure he would drop a brick the size of a cat! Then all that grunting and screaming got more strained and these nodes popped from his shoulders. They pumped rapidly, like the engines of an old car or something. His size shifted and contorted. &quot;Oh boy, we got ourselves a freak here too&quot; I thought. Those twigs he had for arms grotesquely pumped&#39; em selves into massive arms. Like a beast or something! His scrawny legs became tree trunks, and that calm confident voice of his became of a stereotypical black guy.</p>

<p>-Excuse me?-</p>

<p>You know &quot;MAN! AW MAN!&quot; </p>

<p>His voice cracks and stumbles into a cough after deepening his voice.</p>

<p>When he was done with his Scott Steiner impersonation, there was a huge pillar of a meatbag of a man. The dude was now easily 7 and a half feet tall! Alright, so he was bigger now. &quot;Show us whatcha got Boiah!&quot; sneered Mitch. Genetic Freak over there just snorted and leaped away from our line of sight. A few seconds, a big silver SUV just dropped out of the sky, smashing into pieces on my fucking backyard!</p>

<p>&quot;MY FUCKING TRUCK!&quot; bawled Mitch. The rest of us were laughing so hard, that I almost choked on my lunch. After a glass of water, my vision refocused on the demo. Mitch&#39;s truck was smashed into pieces, but the pieces were all rolled into balls of metal debris. &quot;Here, some new lawn sculptures.&quot; I liked this guy! &quot;You&#39;re hired son!&quot; We gave him the bag of money.  150 Million then, and he&#39;d get the rest when he came back with proof.</p>

<p>-You did not swipe credits?-</p>

<p>I know, seriously! He was really old fashioned. Liked it in cash. Anyway, he powered down, back into the scariest pencil necked geek on the face of the earth. Oh yeah, he totally lived up to his name.</p>

<p>-Which was?-</p>

<p>While he walked off, he reassured us &quot;There&#39;s a reason they call me Maim!&quot;  </p>
